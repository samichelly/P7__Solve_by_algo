# P7__Solve_by_algo


## Introduction

Welcome to the 7th project in the Python path at Openclassrooms. The objective of this project is to create two algorithms aimed at maximizing client profits over a two-year investment period. These algorithms come in two versions:

- The Brute-force Version
- The Optimized Version

Both algorithms are designed to provide a list of the most profit-yielding stocks for investment while adhering to specific constraints:

- Each stock can only be purchased once.
- Fractional stock purchases are not allowed.
- The maximum budget for each client is capped at 500 euros.

## Installation

To get started, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samichelly/P7__Solve_by_algo.git
```

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the investment portfolio optimization algorithms by executing the following commands in your terminal:

### Brute-force Version
```bash
python bruteforce.py filename.csv
```

### Optimized Version
