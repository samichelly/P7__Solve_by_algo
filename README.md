 ## Introduction
Welcome to the 7th project in the Python path at Openclassrooms. The objective of this project is to create two algorithms aimed at maximizing client profits over a two-year investment period. These algorithms come in two versions:

- The Brute-force Version
- The Optimized Version
Both algorithms are designed to provide a list of the most profit-yielding stocks for investment while adhering to specific constraints:

Each stock can only be purchased once.
Fractional stock purchases are not allowed.
The maximum budget for each client is capped at 500 euros.
